# spring-boot-api-rest

By developing this project, I learned how to:

- Start a new project with Spring Initializr
- Deal with the basics of a Spring Boot project configuration
- Persist data using Spring Data JPA
- Map entities
- Deal with controllers and repositories
- Apply the DTO pattern and why it's important
- Validate data
- Use Lombok to reduce the amount of boilerplate code
- Perform migrations via Flyway
- Build a REST API with basic CRUD operations
