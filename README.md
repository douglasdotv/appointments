This project is a simple RESTful API for managing a list of doctors. It provides the following endpoints:

- POST /doctors: register a new doctor
- GET /doctors: list all doctors (the list can be paginated by passing size and sort query parameters)
- PUT /doctors: update an existing doctor
- DELETE /doctors/{id}: remove a doctor by ID

The following technologies were used:

- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Hibernate
- MySQL
- Project Lombok
- Bean Validation
